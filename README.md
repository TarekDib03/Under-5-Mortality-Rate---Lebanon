Applied epidemiological methods during the Epidemiology in Public Health course (Johns Hopkins University, Coursera) to analyze the reversal of Lebanon’s Under-5 Mortality Rate trend. Findings showed an increase from 12 to over 18 deaths per 1,000 live births (2019–2024), driven by the economic collapse, COVID-19, strained health systems, and the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis. Identified significant disparities between Lebanese and refugee children, with refugees experiencing disproportionately higher mortality. Proposed evidence-based interventions, including strengthened maternal and child health services, targeted refugee support, equity-focused monitoring, and multisectoral approaches to address underlying determinants.

**Possible Contributing Factors**

Several interrelated crises have contributed to this increase:

- Economic Collapse (2019–present): The sharp deterioration of the Lebanese currency and prolonged economic crisis have drastically reduced household purchasing power, limited access to health services, and increased poverty and food insecurity.

- COVID-19 Pandemic: The pandemic further weakened an already fragile healthcare system, disrupted routine health services, and worsened socioeconomic conditions.

- Healthcare System Strain: Limited resources, shortages of medical supplies, and reduced access to maternal and child health services have constrained essential care.

- Syrian Refugee Crisis: Lebanon hosts a large refugee population, placing immense pressure on already-strained health, education, and social services.

- Living Conditions: Refugees, in particular, face overcrowded housing, poor sanitation, and limited access to adequate nutrition and healthcare, heightening risks for preventable diseases.

**Epidemiological Insights**

The reversal of the U5MR trend illustrates how overlapping health, economic, and political crises can erode decades of public health gains. It also highlights the importance of disaggregated data to capture health inequities between host and refugee populations.

**Recommendations**

- Strengthen Health Systems: Invest in maternal and child health services, ensure supply chain stability, and expand access to affordable care.

- Targeted Interventions: Design tailored programs to reduce mortality among refugee children, addressing nutrition, immunization, and sanitation.

- Health Equity Monitoring: Systematically monitor disparities between host and refugee populations to guide resource allocation.

- Multisectoral Approach: Address root causes such as poverty, food insecurity, and inadequate housing through coordinated health, social, and economic policies.
